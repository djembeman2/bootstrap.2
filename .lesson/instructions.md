# Instructions  

## Introduction

You will make a newspaper called the Spooky Times. You should use the classes `row` and `col` in different ways to acheive a 2, 3 or 4 column effect.

You may choose to set background colors using CSS or try out the color utility classes from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/colors/


## Detailed instructions

You must have at least 3 rows with columns. Try to have a row with 3 cols, 4 cols and three cols with different widths. 

Also, try using at least one other Bootstrap component. For example, you can use the https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images/

Use your wireframe from your breakout room as a guide.

1. Optional: In Tools/Git, start a git repository. Commit changes as you go.
2. Setup Bootstrap CSS See: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/#quick-start
3. Add 3 `row`s in the `main` tag in index.html
4. Set a `container` class on the parent of your rows. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/ 
7. In the first `row`, add three columns.
8. In the second `row`, add four columns.
9. In the last `row` try to make three columns, but set a width so that the columns are different widths.
10. Add text with `h1` tags, `h2` tags, and `p` tags to each column.
11. Add an image to each column.
12. Use some sort of Bootstrap class or component to make your images look good. (You could use `image-fluid` or look into cards.)
13. Do you need to use spacing classes like `p-3` on this one?


### Bonus

* Try out more complex columns where you set the width of the columns with Bootstrap classes. (For example `col-6` would give a column of 50%.)
* Add your wireframe image to the README.md file.
* Use Git to track your changes!
