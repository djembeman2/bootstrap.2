# Instructions  

## Introduction

You will make a newspaper called the Spooky Times. You should use the classes `row` and `col` in different ways to acheive a 2, 3 or 4 column effect.

You may choose to set background colors using CSS or try out the color utility classes from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/colors/


## Detailed instructions

You must have at least 3 rows with columns. Try to have a row with 2 cols, 3 cols and 4 cols. 

Try using at least one other Bootstrap component. For example, you can use the https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images/

If possible, try to build a wireframe in Canva first!
1. Optional: Build a wireframe in Canva. Put an image of the wireframe into the docs folder.
2. Optional: In Tools/Git, start a git repository. Commit changes as you go.
3. Required: Setup Bootstrap CSS See: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/#quick-start
4. Required: add 3 `row`s in the `main` tag in index.html
5. Required: Set a `container` class on the parent of your rows. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/ 
6. Required: In the first `row`, add two columns.
7. Required: In the second `row`, add three columns.
8. Required: In the third `row`, add four columns.
9. Add text with `h1` tags, `h2` tags, and `p` tags to each column.
10. Add an image to each column.
11. Use some sort of Bootstrap class or component to make your images look good. (You could use `image-fluid` or look into cards.)
12. Do you need to use spacing classes like `p-3` on this one?


### Bonus

* Try out complex columns where you set the width of the columns with Bootstrap classes. (For example `col-6` would give a column of 50%.)
* Add your wireframe image to the README.md file.
* Use Git to track your changes!
